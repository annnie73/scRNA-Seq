# Multimodal Single Cell RNA Sequencing

This project involves the analysis of the data obtained from multimodal single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), particularly from human bone marrow donors, where the majority of collected cells are immune cells.


The primary goal is to predict surface protein signals based on gene expression data. This prediction is vital for most publicly available datasets where only RNA count matrices are available, as it aids in identifying and categorizing cells within the sample.

## Data
Multimodal scRNA-seq provides two types of reads for each cell:

* RNA transcript counts reflecting gene expression (marked as X),
* Quantification of surface proteins, directly linked to cell types (marked as y).

##
The project is a final task in statistical data analysis.
